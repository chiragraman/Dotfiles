# chiragraman does dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you configure your system. These are mine.

After spending hours configuring my machine to my liking, I realized that the files weren't organized in a way conducive to synchronizing them across machines. A quick gander through the interwebs for pointers on a better setup led to my discovery of [Github does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/), and subsequently [Zach Holman's sweet setup](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). This setup mimics his topical organization.

Midway through setting these up I decided to jump ship to zsh, and discovered the [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) bundle manager, which these now use.
